# ChatBot_seq2seq
A python based chat-bot based on deep seq2seq model trained to talk and interact like a friend. The system uses a encoder-decoder architecture with each block being a LSTM model. The models were trained on the Movie Dialog dataset and the end product was an interactive python app which could hold a good conversation with a human.
